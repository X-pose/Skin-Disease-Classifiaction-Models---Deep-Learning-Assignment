## Overview

In this project, we explore the application of deep learning techniques for the automated classification of skin diseases using image data. Early and accurate detection of skin diseases is crucial in medicine, as it facilitates timely intervention and improves patient outcomes. Our primary goal is to develop a robust classification model capable of identifying various skin disease types from images with high accuracy, leveraging advanced deep learning techniques.

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to build a model that can accurately classify skin diseases based on image data. We aim to compare different deep learning architectures to determine the most effective model for this task. 

## Methodology

To achieve our goal, we utilized a dataset of labeled skin disease images and employed a supervised learning approach with a transfer learning methodology. Our methodology involved implementing and fine-tuning four state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures, each tackled by a different team member. This approach allowed us to compare the performance of various models and identify the most effective solution for our specific task.

## Architectures Used

We experimented with the following CNN architectures:

- **ResNet50**: Known for its residual connections, allowing the training of very deep networks while mitigating the vanishing gradient problem.
- **VGG16**: Recognized for its simplicity and effectiveness in feature extraction, using a stack of convolutional layers with consistent filter sizes.
- **EfficientNetB0**: Noted for its efficient scaling of network width and depth, achieving high accuracy with fewer parameters.
- **DenseNet121**: Featuring densely connected layers that improve feature propagation and reduce overfitting in complex tasks.

## Conclusion

By comparing these models, we aim to identify the most effective architecture for classifying skin disease types, offering a potential tool for assisting in medical diagnosis through image-based skin disease detection.
